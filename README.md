# Sound_To_MIDI
Computer Science GCSE Project

1. reading_wav.ipynb is the beginning of my project where I first start to play around with the .WAV file.
2. sound_to_MIDI.ipynb is the main part of my project where I investigate all the algorithms needed to go.
3. adding_user_interface is where I start adding things on to the original sound_to_MIDI code so that it is user friendly.
